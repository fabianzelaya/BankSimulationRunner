# Data structures

## Data structures
A **`data structure`** is a way of organizing, storing, and performing operations on data. Operations performed on a data structure include accessing or updating stored data, searching for specific data, inserting new data, and removing data. The following provides a list of basic data structures.

## Table 14.1.1: Basic data structures.
| Data structure | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Record | A **`record`** is the data structure that stores subitems, often called fields, with a name associated with each subitem. |
| Array | An **`array`** is a data structure that stores an ordered list of items, where each item is directly accessible by a positional index. |
| Linked list | A **`linked list`** is a data structure that stores an ordered list of items in nodes, where each node stores data and has a pointer to the next node. |
| Binary tree | A **`binary tree`** is a data structure in which each node stores data and has up to two children, known as a left child and a right child. |
| Hash table | A **`hash table`** is a data structure that stores unordered items by mapping (or hashing) each item to a location in an array. |
| Heap | A **`max-heap`** is a tree that maintains the simple property that a node's key is greater than or equal to the node's childrens' keys. A **`min-heap`** is a tree that maintains the simple property that a node's key is less than or equal to the node's childrens' keys. |
| Graph | A **`graph`** is a data structure for representing connections among items, and consists of vertices connected by edges. A **`vertex`** represents an item in a graph. An **`edge`** represents a connection between two vertices in a graph. |
